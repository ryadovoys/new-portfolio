## What Makes Sergey Unusual

Design leaders who can operate inside ambiguity and prototype real AI systems are rare. Sergey bridges gaps that usually require multiple people:

- **Full-stack design thinking**: Moves fluidly from brand → system → interaction → agent logic
- **Speaks three languages**: Design, engineering, and AI tooling—removes translation cost between teams
- **Builds, not just directs**: Prototypes with code (Claude Code, Cursor, JavaScript) and system instructions, not just Figma mockups
- **Craft + speed**: Strong visual foundations (typography, composition, 100+ logos) combined with rapid iteration mindset
- **AI-native workflow**: Uses generative AI daily in production work, not just experiments

Most design leaders either come from pure visual backgrounds or pure product backgrounds. Sergey has both—plus hands-on AI prototyping skills that let him design for LLM nuances (latency, context limits, multimodal inputs) from firsthand experience.

## Skills & Competencies

### AI Product Design & Conversational Interfaces

- LLM-powered interfaces, conversational AI, context management, multimodal experiences
- AI prototyping with system instructions, prompt engineering, API integration
- Human-in-the-loop design patterns for responsible AI
- Generative media pipelines: image/video generation in UI contexts

### Generative AI Tools

**Image Generation**: Midjourney, Visual Electric, Qwen, Google Nano Banana Pro
**Video Generation**: Kling, Wan, Sora, Higgsfield
**Pipelines**: ComfyUI, Weavy, custom workflows

### AI Development Workflows

- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Antigravity
- MCP tools
- OpenRouter, Replicate integrations

### Motion & Interaction Design

- Figma prototyping for quick motion examples
- ProtoPie, Principle for prototyping

- Fluid interfaces for AI-driven products

### Design Systems

- Built systems for: Visa, Amway, RaceTrac
- Components, tokens, variables, documentation
- Adaptive design for web, desktop, mobile
- Behavioral data and analytics-informed design

### Design Systems in the Age of AI

Traditional design systems assume deterministic outputs—click button, see result. AI changes this fundamentally:

- **Variability as a feature**: Components must handle unpredictable content lengths, dynamic layouts, and streaming states
- **Tokens for AI contexts**: Designing token systems that work across chat interfaces, multimodal outputs, and agent-driven flows
- **Conversational interfaces as living systems**: Chat UIs aren't static—they need states for thinking, typing, error recovery, and context limits
- **Human-in-the-loop patterns**: Building review/approval flows into systems where AI generates but humans verify
- **Latency-aware design**: Loading states, skeleton screens, and progressive disclosure for LLM response times

This intersection—systems thinking applied to AI interfaces—is where Sergey's experience with both enterprise design systems (Visa, Amway) and AI product design (Digitas AI platform, Mindcomplete) becomes uniquely valuable.

### Technical Skills & Prototyping

**Design Tools**: Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite
**Code**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (fundamentals)
**Prototyping**: Figma prototypes, Figma Makes, code-based prototypes
**3D/AR**: Experience with 3D, AR, NFT projects

### Visual Design & Branding

- Typography, composition, grid systems, color theory
- 100+ logos designed throughout career
- Brand identities featured in Logolounge, Dieline, Packaging of the World
- Packaging design expertise

### How Sergey Leads

- **Show, don't tell**: Sets quality bar by making examples himself rather than just critiquing
- **Questions over directives**: In reviews, asks questions that help designers find answers themselves
- **Prototype to prove**: When disagreeing with direction, builds quick prototype or shows data instead of arguing
- **Autonomy with clarity**: Gives team members space to execute, but expects clear problem framing upfront
- **Mentorship by context**: Adjusts approach for seniors (strategic challenges) vs mids (craft and process)

---

## How Sergey Makes Decisions

- **Speed vs quality**: Fast iterations first, refine details after direction is locked—most efficient path
- **Conflict resolution**: Always explains reasoning, not just preference. Open to compromise after being heard
- **User as tiebreaker**: When no clear solution, defaults to user advocate position. Will push for user testing
- **Pick important battles**: Doesn't fight every disagreement—saves energy for decisions that truly matter
- **Context over rules**: No universal playbook. Reads stakeholders and project constraints before choosing approach

---
