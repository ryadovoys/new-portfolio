# Resume Text — Refined Version

## Main Introduction (Left Column)

Hi, my name is Sergey Ryadovoy. I'm a design leader located in Cupertino, CA.

15 years in design and leadership — from branding and visual design to digital products and AI.

Currently VP of Experience Design at Digitas, leading AI product for various brands and internal AI solutions.

I believe in finding solutions, not following rules. Every design decision balances user needs with business goals. I connect design to business outcomes and work closely with engineers to ship what was designed.

I sit at a rare intersection: brand design, digital product, code, and AI. Strong visual foundation — years of typography, composition, UI design and branding. Early adopter — using AI systematically since the beginning. Obsessed with automation and finding smarter workflows. Few people combine all of these.

## Card Texts (Right Column)

### AI Fluency
Use AI across the entire workflow: research, ideation, UX, visuals, prototyping, code. Deep understanding of infrastructure (models, RAG, APIs, MCPs).

### AI Prototyping & Tools
Built complex workflows for task management and rapid prototyping. Use it daily to create internal tools, apps, and speed up design iteration.

### Product Thinking
Partner, not executor. Formulate hypotheses, connect design to metrics, bridge the gap between Figma and production. Run workshops with dev teams to ship what was designed.

### Design Systems
Built design systems in Figma for Visa, RaceTrac, Amway, and more. Components, tokens, variables, documentation. Built foundations to scale across teams.

### UI/UX Design
Led product design for Visa's global digital presence — websites, apps, dashboards. Directed redesigns for Amway, RaceTrac, and Delta Airlines.

### Strong Foundations
Composition, typography, color, form — shaped by years in branding. Featured in Logolounge, Dieline, Packaging of the World.
