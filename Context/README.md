## Key Concepts

### This is NOT a traditional portfolio
- No project case studies
- No "click to see more"
- Skills-based presentation using cards

### Each card = one skill/area
- Short headline
- 2-3 sentences
- Visual (image, gallery, video, or animation)

### Goal
Visitor understands Sergey's experience in 60 seconds of scrolling. Details discussed in meetings.

This is the core message. Everything should support it.
