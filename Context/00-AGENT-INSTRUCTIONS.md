# Agent Instructions: Portfolio Website Development

## Overview

You are helping Sergey Ryadovoy build a portfolio website. This is NOT a traditional portfolio with project case studies. Instead, it's a **skills-based presentation** using interactive cards.

## Core Concept

Each card represents a **skill or area of expertise**, not a project. Cards contain:
- Short, punchy headline
- 2-3 sentences of text (concise, no fluff)
- Visual: image, scroll-through gallery, animation, or video

The goal: visitors can understand Sergey's experience **without clicking into anything**. Details are discussed in meetings, not on the website.

## Files in This Context

1. `00-AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` — This file. Start here.
2. `01-BACKGROUND.md` — Sergey's professional background and positioning
3. `02-RESUME-TEXT.md` — The refined resume text we developed
4. `03-CARDS-PROFESSIONAL.md` — Professional skill cards (AI, Design Systems, etc.)
5. `04-CARDS-PERSONAL.md` — Personal/inspiration cards (music, culture, etc.)
6. `05-LINKEDIN-PROFILE.md` — LinkedIn experience for reference

## Design Principles

- **Short text**: Each card = 2-3 sentences max
- **Show, don't tell**: Visuals do the heavy lifting
- **No project deep-dives**: This is a skill showcase, not case studies
- **Personal touch**: Include inspiration/personal cards to show personality
- **Scannable**: Someone should "get" Sergey in 60 seconds of scrolling

## Technical Notes

- Cards should be interactive (scroll galleries, hover states, etc.)
- Mobile-friendly
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Consider animation for logo reels, brand showcases

## Your Tasks

1. Review all context files
2. Help build the card components
3. Source/organize visuals from Sergey's folders
4. Suggest improvements to card text if needed
5. Build the website structure

## Questions to Ask Sergey

- Where are your project files stored? (Figma exports, screenshots, etc.)
- Do you have video recordings of your tools/workflows?
- Which cards are highest priority?
- Any specific visual style references?
