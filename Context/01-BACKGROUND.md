# Sergey Ryadovoy — Background & Positioning

## Who Is Sergey

Design leader based in Cupertino, CA. 15 years in design — from branding and visual design to digital products and AI.

Currently **VP of Experience Design at Digitas**, leading AI product design for brands like Visa, Mondelez, and internal AI tools.

## Unique Positioning

Sergey sits at a **rare intersection**:
- Brand design (visual craft, typography, composition)
- Digital product (UI/UX, design systems)
- Code (can build, prototype, speak developer language)
- AI (early adopter, deep understanding of infrastructure)

**Few people combine all of these.**

## Key Differentiators

### 1. AI Depth
Not just an AI user — understands the infrastructure:
- Models, APIs, RAG, vector search, embeddings, MCPs
- Knows what's possible, what's expensive, where design can push tech
- Uses AI systematically across entire workflow

### 2. Design + Engineering Bridge
- Works closely with developers
- Runs workshops with dev teams
- Closes the gap between Figma and production
- Ships what was designed — no compromises

### 3. Strong Visual Foundation
- Years in branding and packaging
- Typography, composition, color, form
- Featured in Logolounge, Dieline, Packaging of the World
- Peace Sans font — 500K+ downloads

### 4. Automation Obsession
- Always looking for ways to integrate, automate, simplify
- Apple Shortcuts, custom scripts, AI pipelines
- Builds tools when they don't exist

## Philosophy

> "Finding solutions, not following rules. Every design decision balances user needs with business goals."

> "I pick the right tool for the problem, not the trendy one."

## Target Roles

- VP of Design at AI companies
- Head of Design / Design Director
- Roles that need someone who bridges design and technology

## Brands Worked With

Visa, Mondelez, Amway, Delta Airlines, RaceTrac, Nutrilite, GoodEggs, FIS, Snowflake, and 50+ others across career.
