# LinkedIn Post Draft

---

Working on my latest personal website and came up with something I haven't seen before.

Instead of just a resume PDF, I created a "Download Context" button. It gives you a markdown file with everything about me — experience, skills, projects, how I work, what I value.

The idea: you drop it into any AI (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT) and ask questions about me. Like having a conversation with my portfolio.

"Is he a good fit for an AI design lead role?"
"What's his experience with design systems?"
"Show me his AI-related projects."

The AI knows the answers because it has the full context.

Why markdown? It's lightweight, AI-friendly, and works everywhere. No login, no app — just a file.

Feels like the natural evolution of portfolios in the AI era. Your website becomes a knowledge base, not just a gallery.

Curious if others are experimenting with this. Would love to see what you come up with.
